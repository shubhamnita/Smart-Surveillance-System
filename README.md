# Smart-Surveillance-System

A Smart Surveillance Security & Monitoring System is an application which is developed from
the security point of view. The objective of this project is to develop a system that monitors the
area in which it is being implemented. An Intelligent Surveillance System is applicable in the
area where less percentage of movement is observed, also where we need to detect if any
motion has been done.
It has motion detection capability that can provide precaution to potential crimes. The credit
card size Raspberry Pi3(RPI 3) with Python-OpenCV programme handles the image
processing algorithms which detects any motion and control algorithms for sending notification
and captured video to userâ€™s email via Wi- Fi. The system uses ordinary camera which records
all the time and send captured video frames to RPI 3 to process. The proposed home security
system captures information and transmits it via a Wi-Fi to a Smart phone or any network
device using web application. Raspberry pi 3 operates and controls video cameras for remote
sensing and surveillance, streams live video through if required by user, records it for future playback.
